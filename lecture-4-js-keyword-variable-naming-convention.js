//variable naming convention

//VARIABLE NAME IS CASE SENSITIVE*

//javascript keyword or reserve words is key sensitive

/* rules for naming variable

1. can't use reserve keyword as variable name such as
var false = 15; is a invalid variable

2. name should be one word but can use more than one word by using underscore _
ex: var my_name = "Muntasir Tonmoy"; is a valid variable
var my name = "Muntasir Tonmoy" is invalid.
but js programmer don't use underscore the normally uppercase the first letter of the next word
ex: var myName = "Muntasir Tonmoy";
var myOfficeAddress = "sweet home"; it is called camel case.

3. Quote mark is not allowed in variable name
ex: var "my name" = "Muntasie Tonmoy"; is invalid

4. can't use numeric in the first latter but can use numeric in 2nd latter or after.
ex: var 99price = "99"; invalid
